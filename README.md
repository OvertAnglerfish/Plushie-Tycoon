Plushie Tycoon Autoplayer  

Purpose: Automate certain tasks for the game Plushie Tycoon on Neopets  
Link: http://www.neopets.com/games/tycoon/index.phtml  
How to Use: Install the Tampermonkey extension for Google Chrome or the Greasemonkey extension for Firefox, copy and paste the code into a new script and you should be all set!  

I don't recommend using without knowing how to play the game first. Use at your own risk.  

Here are the steps to get the program started:
1. Create a new game of plushie tycoon
2. Go to the main page
3. Click the button that says "Set up new store."
4. Once it's done, click "Start"
5. Let it run!

You can change what timezone it picks by changing the field in the script.

Here's a quick overview of what the program can and cannot do:

The program will:
Buy materials and start jobs when materials are cheap enough
Hire and fire employees to make plushies without going bankrupt
Ship the plushies when they're ready
Upgrade factory and store size as necessary
Refresh every few minutes to check for updates

It also has a little sidebar of useful information below the Neofriends box.

The program will not:
Upgrade your warehouse size
Buy Advertisements or upgrades for your shop beyond the initial set-up purchase
Pay rents (can be done by clicking the button on the home page)
WARNING: If you have workers hired after the last update of the day, make sure you open the plushie tycoon page before the second update the next day. Otherwise, you could possibly go bankrupt and end your game.
If the program ever seems to be stuck, try hitting the reset button on the main page.
